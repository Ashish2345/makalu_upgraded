                      Ensure you are in good physical condition before embarking on a trek or mountaineering expedition. Engage in regular exercise and training to build strength and endurance.

                      Take time to acclimatize properly to higher altitudes to prevent altitude sickness. Ascend gradually, hydrate well, and listen to your body. If you experience symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or nausea, descend to a lower elevation and seek medical attention if necessary.
