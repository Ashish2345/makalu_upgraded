                <p class="mt-10">
                    In accordance with government regulations, it is imperative to note that foreign nationals are unable to obtain insurance within Nepal. Therefore, it is a fundamental requirement for our clients to secure comprehensive travel insurance packages (covering medical expenses, air evacuation, search and rescue missions) in their home countries. Trekking and expedition adventures are inherently associated with certain uncertainties, including medical emergencies and natural calamities, particularly in high-altitude regions. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our clients and strongly recommend that they obtain insurance coverage for helicopter evacuations, trip cancellations, and personal accidents. This safeguards them from experiencing undue financial burdens in unforeseen circumstances.                  
                    <br><br>
                    Our agency will request clients to provide their personal and insurance details to facilitate swift and efficient handling of any unpredictable situations. In the event of a rescue requirement, our company will initiate contact with reputable rescue service providers and manage all necessary documentation and procedures.                
                    <br><br>
                
                    Please be aware that the company assumes no responsibility for any financial losses or compensation in cases where a guest's insurance fails to cover some or all aspects of the trip.

                    Clients should be aware that no compensation will be provided under any circumstances if they choose to abstain from commencing a trek or expedition due to personal injury or any other reasons. Furthermore, if the government revokes permits for a trek or expedition due to unforeseen disasters in the area, clients shall not seek reimbursement for their payment. We encourage clients to exercise caution and consider travel insurance to address unforeseen events that may impact their trip. Your safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding of these policies.                  <br><br>

                    As a guest, it is imperative that you adhere to the rules and regulations of the country during your stay. Engaging in any illegal activities is strongly discouraged, and any intentional or unintentional violation of the law by a guest will not impose an obligation upon the company to advocate on their behalf. Should any illegal activities be witnessed on the part of a client, the company reserves the right to alert the appropriate authorities and cooperate fully with them. In the event that a client faces legal consequences due to unlawful actions, the company is not liable to provide financial compensation.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, during your tour, trek, or expedition, the appointed team leader assumes authority, and their decisions are considered final. Our team leaders and guides are selected based on years of training and extensive experience in mountainous regions. To ensure the safety and well-being of our clients, we strongly encourage guests to heed the instructions of our team leaders and guides and refrain from any actions contrary to their guidance. In the event of conflicts between clients, whether verbal, physical, or otherwise, the company's staff will intervene to resolve the issue, and if necessary, may involve law enforcement.

                    The packages crafted by Makalu Mountaineering Pvt. Ltd. adhere to rigorous standards, benefiting from the wisdom of experienced professionals. However, we acknowledge the unique preferences of our clients and are open to customizing packages based on your requests, provided you are willing to accommodate the associated additional time and costs. Additionally, circumstances in the region may sometimes necessitate alterations to the standard cost and timing.
                    <br><br>
                    In such cases, adjustments to price and time can be agreed upon through mutual discussion between clients and the company. Damage to company equipment, trip delays, requests for additional services beyond the initially agreed-upon terms, and other similar circumstances initiated by the client may result in an increase in the previously established price. Our aim is to ensure your experience is tailored to your needs while maintaining transparency in our arrangements.

                    There may be instances when the scheduled itinerary concludes a few days ahead of the designated timeframe. In such cases, it's important to note that the company will not issue refunds to clients. For example, if a tour package spans 14 days but concludes in 12 days, the company will not reimburse the costs for the two unutilized days.

                                    The locations of our treks and expeditions are often situated in demanding environments, far removed from the luxuries of the 21st century. It is important to recognize that expectations of normalcy may not always be met. Occasionally, despite our best efforts, clients may not receive precisely what they anticipated, even when willing to pay for it. As a hosting company, we strive to offer the most reasonable and fulfilling experiences possible. However, in certain situations, we may encounter limitations in delivering all that we have promised. During such times, we rely on our guests to display understanding and adapt to the available circumstances. Above all, we encourage guests to thoroughly comprehend the nature of their chosen adventure before booking, ensuring alignment with their expectations. We are committed to providing exceptional experiences, but it is crucial that our guests are well-prepared for the unique challenges that may arise in remote and demanding locations.

                    For any additional activities such as skiing, drone flights, paragliding, or large flag displays, clients are required to inform the company in advance. These extra activities are subject to charges imposed by the Nepal Government. Failure to inform the company in advance will result in clients bearing all associated costs, and the company will not assume any responsibility. However, if notified in advance, the company will ensure that all necessary procedures and permits are obtained. Any activities listed above that are undertaken by clients without prior notification and proper permits will be considered illegal acts.
